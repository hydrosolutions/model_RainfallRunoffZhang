The module model_RainfallRunoffZhang contains wrappers for an example rainfall runoff model that is programmed in matlab. 
The wrapper and model (available in tests/model/bin) have been tested extensively.

Ant is used to build the jars. The description of how to build the module is given in the openDA documentation.

Installation guide for mac:
- Open ~/.profile (not ~./bashrc as stated in the openDA installation guides. 
  ~/.bashrc is not read automatically upon login). Add the following lines:
      $ export OPENDADIR=<bindir>
      $ . $OPENDADIR/setup_openda.sh 
  <bindir> is the path to the bin openDA-bin directory where you stored the jar
  files. For example /Application/openDA_2.2/bin/.
