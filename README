The module model_RainfallRunoffZhang contains wrappers for an example rainfall runoff model that is programmed in matlab. The wrapper and model (available in tests/model/bin) have been tested extensively.

Ant is used to build the jars. The description of how to build the module is given in the openDA documentation.
